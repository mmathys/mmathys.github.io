For my [matriculation project](https://github.com/mmathys/Matura-Paper) I
developed different types of interactuve diagrams, which can be shown on the
web.

In this paper it was investigated how point and line graphs can be improved by
interaction, so that the user can deal more efficiently with the presented data
and the analysis and the understanding of the data is simplified.

A web application for the display of 2- and 3-dimensional data sets
was developed. The technology of a web application has been
presented (JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SVG), the application design (UI,
configuration, filtering, mapping, rendering) and problems
which occurred during the development have been documented.

In this work the concepts of data visualization (Visualization Pipeline)
and the design of user interfaces (Information-Seeking
Mantra) were explained.

The developed interactive chart implements interaction methods which are common
(such as Zoom, Filter, Details-on-demand) or rarely used in practice
(reduction of three- to two-dimensional scatter plots by projection).
